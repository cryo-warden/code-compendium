This is a monorepo for any sort of code I feel like writing, including but not limited to:

- Playing with new languages
- Trying out new algorithms and architectures
- Making whatever I might enjoy making.

This is a **closed-source** repo. Even if you have the right to read this code, you do not have the right to copy or reproduce it. All rights are reserved by the repo creator. There are no plans to accept contributions here.

Sub-projects originally developed here might be licensed by the owner at a later date, which will involve moving them into a new repo. Those other repos are likely to use an OSS license and allow contributions. I cannot accept contributions here because I need to retain the sole right to license this code, for simplicity's sake if I decide to spin off anything open-source or proprietary.
