I'm learning Rust and practicing it by building a lightweight ECS game engine for multiplayer text-based RPG games.

I'm writing this after a week of practice. Currently, I have a very simple geometry library with a partially implemented bounding-box hierarchy.

The next step is to add node deletion to the hierarchy. Since this should be an optimized operation, this will probably involve learning how to use Rust's lifetime system.

After I'm done implementing the core operations for the bounding-box hierarchy, I'll begin figuring out how to construct an ECS world, in particular one that has to manage a variety of differently-shaped component data, the structure of which is not even known until someone is using the library. I might have no choice but to learn macros to generate different world structs and implementations, depending on the archetypes allowed in some set of systems. We'll see.
